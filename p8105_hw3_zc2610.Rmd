```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
## Problem 2
Import data
```{r}
acc_df = read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
combine all activity columns
```{r}
acc_df = acc_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_minute",
    values_to = "counts",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
  )
```
create a weekday vs weekend variable
```{r}
acc_df = acc_df %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Friday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "weekend",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "weekend",
      TRUE     ~ ""
    )
  ) 
```

```{r}
colnames(acc_df)
nrow(acc_df)
ncol(acc_df)
```

Description

1. The resulting dataset contains following variables: `r colnames(acc_df)`

2. There are totally `r nrow(acc_df)` observations and `r ncol(acc_df)` variables in the resulting dataset

create a variable that sums up counts of activities in each day and show in a table
```{r}
acc_df %>% 
  group_by(week,day_id,day) %>% 
  summarise(
    total_activity = sum(`counts`)
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

single panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each day

```{r}
acc_df %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = activity_minute,y = counts,color = day)) +
   geom_point() 
```
