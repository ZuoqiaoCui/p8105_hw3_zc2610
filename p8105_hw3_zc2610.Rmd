## Problem 2
Import data
```{r}
acc_df = read.csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```
combine all activity columns
```{r}
acc_df = acc_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity",
    values_to = "counts/minute",
    names_prefix = "activity_"
  )
```
create a weekday vs weekend variable
```{r}
acc_df = acc_df %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_or_weekend = case_when(
      day == "Monday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Tuesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Wednesday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Thursday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Friday" ~ "weekday",
      day == "Saturday" ~ "weekend",
      day == "Sunday" ~ "weekend",
      TRUE     ~ ""
